The New Deblok is a project ditching what Deblok used to run off of, Kasm Workspaces; and using a DIY solution with the help of [DeblokManager](https://github.com/Deblok-Workshop/DeblokManager) to dynamically spawn and kill Docker containers easily, also using [noVNC](https://github.com/noVNC/noVNC) for remote control.

## What is Deblok?

Deblok is a selfhostable website that allows you to browse and stream apps, games, and operating systems safely, remotely, and securely. Completely for free, with minimal paywalls.

## For chromebook skids

- I **strongly **do not** recommend** you to deploy NewDeblok to a service like Vercel.
- Use `bun run build` instead of `bun run watch` if you don't need to watch the files.
- You \***\*have\*\*** to selfhost DeblokManager. It cannot be deployed to a service like Vercel.
