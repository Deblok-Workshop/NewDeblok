The New Deblok is a project developed by [Rare](https://github.com/uhidontkno), [Yusof](https://github.com/yoloyusof), [John](https://github.com/Notplayingallday383), and [Isaiah](https://github.com/QuartzWarrior).

## What is Deblok?
Want complete privacy, well heres Deblok. Instead of using some shitty proxy like [Surfskip](https://rare1k.dev/surfskipisass) and others (no disrespect to Nebula and TN ❤️)

Deblok is a selfhostable website that allows you to browse safely, remotely, and securely,.

## No more paywalls

Hahahahahha. You probably (thought) that this was too good to be true, and that there are definitely some things locked behind paywalls. **HELL NO**, no more paywalls, we are tired of having to pay for things like this.
