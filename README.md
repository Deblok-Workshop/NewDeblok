The New Deblok is a project ditching what Deblok used to run off of, Kasm Workspaces; and using a DIY solution with the help of [DeblokManager](https://github.com/Deblok-Workshop/DeblokManager) to dynamically spawn and kill Docker containers easily, also using [noVNC](https://github.com/noVNC/noVNC) for remote control.

## What is Deblok?

Deblok is a selfhostable website that allows you to browse and stream apps, games, and operating systems safely, remotely, and securely. Completely for free, with minimal paywalls.

> [!NOTE]
> There is some additional things you can buy which are **supplementary** on the Deblok Discord.
> Deblok+ is **optional**, and your free experience is not effected by not having Deblok+.
> Buy Deblok+ on the discord: [discord.gg/deblok](https://discord.gg/deblok)
