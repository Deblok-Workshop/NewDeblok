> Me, rare, the biggest contributor & owner of Deblok has lost motivation to work on the project at this time and would like someone else to finish the project for me. I am **not** departing from Deblok, and will still be providing hosting and domains. I will check and look at every single Pull Request and issue.

### The state of New Deblok:

- Total: ~50% complete
- DeblokManager: 100% complete, nothing needs work in this area
- Backend: 100% complete, nothing needs work in this area
- Frontend: 32% done, the entire dash needs to be implemented
- Nginx & Bare: 0% done, This will be needed once NewDeblok goes prod

The New Deblok is a project ditching what Deblok used to run off of, Kasm Workspaces; and using a DIY solution with the help of [DeblokManager](https://github.com/Deblok-Workshop/DeblokManager) to dynamically spawn and kill Docker containers easily, also using [noVNC](https://github.com/noVNC/noVNC) for remote control.

## What is Deblok?

Deblok is a selfhostable website that allows you to browse and stream apps, games, and operating systems safely, remotely, and securely. Completely for free, with minimal paywalls.

> [!NOTE]
> There is some additional things you can buy which are **supplementary** on the Deblok Discord.
> Deblok+ is **optional**, and your free experience is not effected by not having Deblok+.
> Buy Deblok+ on the discord: [discord.gg/deblok](https://discord.gg/deblok)

## For chromebook skids

- I **strongly **do not** recommend** you to deploy NewDeblok to a service like Vercel.
- Use `bun run buildonce` instead of `bun run build` if you don't need to watch the files.
- You \***\*have\*\*** to selfhost DeblokManager. It cannot be deployed to a service like Vercel.
